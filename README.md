## Project Goal
Build an AI system that predicts radiological findings from chest X-rays **and**
provides visual explanations showing what image regions influenced the decision.

We aim to improve **trust and interpretability** of medical AI.

---

## Features (planned)
- Baseline CNN classifier (ResNet)
- Zero-shot Vision-Language inference (CLIP / BLIP-2)
- Prompt-based pathology querying
- Grad-CAM / attention heatmaps
- Quantitative + qualitative evaluation
